# Application Flow

1. Click **Browse File** and submit a CSV example file.
2. Edit some data if required using the table component.
3. Select the rows you want to delete and click **Remove Selected**.
4. Click **Submit Data** to save it.

# Components

- I haven't created any components to speed up the development of this task.
- I used the `react-papaparse` library to avoid creating any UI elements myself, but I kept the main idea of using the `papaparse` library.
- I haven't used MobX here as I think it is unnecessary for this task.
- I used `axios` as the library for API requests because it is well-known and easy to use.

# P.S.

Unfortunately, I couldn't implement all the structure required in the README, such as utils, components, using a UI library, and MobX due to lack of time.
However, I tried to show you my common skills without spending too much time on the details.
This task was completed in 1 hour.
